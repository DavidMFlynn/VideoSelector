I could find one, so I built one.
The main pcb and selector switch pcbs are connected by ethernet patch cables.
Each station can select (with a gray code rotory encoder) which cammera to view.
Box 3D has a 3D printable box.

The PCBs are made with kicad.  Two of the wires on port 2 are swapped, fixed in software.
I know its unlikely anyone will want one, but it makes a good example project.
